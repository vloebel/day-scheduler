**Modification History**  

* set up clock - code the scheduler past/presesnt/future
* Research time library - Moment.js?
* Capture save buttons, write text to local storage
* Make text fields editable
* Set up HTML & basic CSS

## Overview
Create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. The application (potentially) uses the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time.

## Requirements
* Daily planner that saves and loads from local storage
* Current day displayed at top of calendar
* One timeblock for each hour from 9 to 5 (business hours)
* Color code blocks relative to past/present/future
* Click a timeblock to enter an event for that time
* Clicking a save button saves that timeblock (only)
* Data persists through browser refresh

## Mockup

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
