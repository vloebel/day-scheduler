**Modification History**  

* load and save from local storage
* write list and style calendar
* Set up HTML & basic CSS

TBD: Source html and css were provided, and our Instructor gave us a sample bootstrap row to use. The resulting schedule appears compressed in width. Class instructor said not to focus on it for this assignment.

## Overview
Create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the business day. The application uses the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time.

## Requirements
* Daily planner that saves and loads from local storage
* Current date displayed at top of calendar
* One timeblock for each hour from 9 to 5 (business hours)
* Color code blocks relative to past/present/future
* Click a timeblock to enter an event for that time
* Clicking a save button saves that timeblock (only)
* Data persists through browser refresh or reboot

## Mockup

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
